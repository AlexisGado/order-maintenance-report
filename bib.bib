  abstract  = {The order maintenance problem is that of maintaining a list under a sequence of Insert and Delete operations, while answering Order queries (determine which of two elements comes first in the list). We give two new algorithms for this problem. The first algorithm matches the O(1) amortized time per operation of the best previously known algorithm, and is much simpler. The second algorithm permits all operations to be performed in O(1) worst-case time.},

  abstract  = {In the Order-Maintenance Problem, the objective is to maintain a total order subject to insertions, deletions, and precedence queries. Known optimal solutions, due to Dietz and Sleator, are complicated. We present new algorithms that match the bounds of Dietz and Sleator. Our solutions are simple, and we present experimental evidence that suggests that they are superior in practice.},
